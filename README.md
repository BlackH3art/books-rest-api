# books-rest-api

This is simple REST API, where you are able to send requests and:
- create book
- get all books
- delete book

Everything will be stored in local `sqlite` file data base.

Application is created with `Active Record` pattern and two different approaches:
- procedural - *(branch: main)*
- object oriented programming - *(branch: main-oop)*

---------

To test this application, first clone this repository:
```
gh repo clone BlackH3art/books-rest-api
```
Install all necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Now you can start application and send your first requests:
```
npm start
```
